### 👩🏼‍💻 My Front-End Portfolio

Hi 👋🏻 - My name is Marian and I'm an amateur Frontend Developer. <br>
The below is a summary of all the websites I've coded from scratch. 
<br>
<br>


#### `First Webpage` <br>
Final project for the [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/graduates/12677-marian-eerens) Basics worskhop. The assignment was to create a single page on a topic of our choice and include a set list of HTML elements, add CSS styling and an animated button using Javascript. <br>

#### `Weather App`<br>
Final project for the [SheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/graduates/12677-marian-eerens) Plus workshop and first attempt at creating an application in Javascript using the Open Weather API. Check out my code repository on Github for more context. <br>

#### `Linktree`<br>
Because I don't really like any of the platforms currently available, I decided to create my own design for a 'Link Tree' using HTML, simple CSS styling and some cool effects courtesy of [Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/). <br>
